There were non-numerical values in numerical fields that we had to replace with appropriate values or drop from our data altogether. There was also data for inactive schools that would only add noise to our data and as such we decided to drop those inactive schools from our data. The absence of such schools should not impact any of our models or the outcomes of the models. "

We are looking to find out way to model and predict if certain student body composition and the FRLP statistics of a school can be used to predict whether a school qualifies for Title I. An early detection and prediction of Title I eligibility of a school would help the school and the policymakers to anticipate the growing poverty status in the area the school serves and provide the school with additional funds in time for it to proactively start and implement various programs associated with Title I designation.  \n",

Sharing this data with other social services agencies could help implement other programs and projects in conjunction with school related programs and projects to address the diverse causes that might be contributing to the growing poverty in the community. \n",
