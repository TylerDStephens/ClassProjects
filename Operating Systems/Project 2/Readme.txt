Project 2. Tyler Stephens 7/21/22
Please run on the TxState Linux server Eros/Zeus. 
Use the gcc shhh.c -o shhh, command to initialize and the ./shhh command to run. 

I have also added some screenshots from when I ran the code on the Linux server through the git bash application in the 
CS Derick Computer lab. The input.txt and file.txt will already have some stuff written in them so you can use them for testing.
The output.txt file I have left blank so you can see the output be written to it.
Lastly please make sure you input the commands and file names correctly or else code will have a segementation error or it just
won't do anything. Also the program can't create new files so use the existing ones.
