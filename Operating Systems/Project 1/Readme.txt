Project 1 Tyler Stephens
For all the programs when checking to ensure they work please run them on one of the Linux servers provided by Texas state (Eros is the one I used).
I have also provided screenshots to show they worked when I ran them on the eros server. For pre and sort keep the list of students below 10 as that is the max size of the
struct I used. Their names should also not exceed 10 characters long. Also when initializing the pipe program with gcc pipe.c -o pipe for the pipe program.
